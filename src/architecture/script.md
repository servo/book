## DOM Bindings

DOM bindings are implementation of webidl interfaces. The webidl interfaces are located `components/script_bindings/webidls/`; these define the interfaces names, their attributes, and their methods. The implementation of these interfaces is located in `components/script/dom/`. The implementation includes the actual data the object contains.
