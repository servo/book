# The Servo Book

**[API docs](https://doc.servo.org/servo/)**

***

[_Servo_](https://servo.org) is a web browser engine written in the Rust programming language, and currently developed on 64-bit Linux, 64-bit macOS, 64-bit Windows, and Android.

Work is still ongoing to make Servo consumable as a webview library.
Currently, the recommended way to run Servo as a browser is via [_servoshell_](https://servo.org/download/), our [winit](https://crates.io/crates/winit) and [egui](https://crates.io/crates/egui)-based demo browser.
If youâ€™d like to embed Servo in your own application, consider using [tauri-runtime-verso](https://github.com/versotile-org/tauri-runtime-verso), a custom [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) runtime, or [servo-gtk](https://github.com/nacho/servo-gtk), a GTK4-based web browser widget.

This book will be your guide to building and running servoshell, hacking on and contributing to Servo, the architecture of Servo, and how to consume Servo and its libraries.

**This book is a work in progress!**
