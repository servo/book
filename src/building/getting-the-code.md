# Getting the code

To make changes to Servo or build servoshell yourself, clone [the main repo](https://github.com/servo/servo) with Git:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/servo/servo.git
$ cd servo
```

<div class="warning _note">

**Servo’s repository is pretty big!**
If you have an unreliable network connection or limited disk space, consider [making a shallow clone](https://github.blog/2020-12-21-get-up-to-speed-with-partial-clone-and-shallow-clone/).

Once you've cloned the Servo source code, the [next step is to install dependencies and build Servo](building.md).
