# Getting Servo

You can download the latest prebuilt version of servoshell from the [Downloads section](https://servo.org/download) on our website.
[Older nightly releases](https://github.com/servo/servo-nightly-builds/releases) are available in the [servo/servo-nightly-builds](https://github.com/servo/servo-nightly-builds) repo.

## Downloading the source

To make changes to Servo or build servoshell yourself, clone [the main repo](https://github.com/servo/servo) with Git:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/servo/servo.git
$ cd servo
```

Servoâ€™s main repo is pretty big!
If you have an unreliable network connection or limited disk space, consider [making a shallow clone](https://github.blog/2020-12-21-get-up-to-speed-with-partial-clone-and-shallow-clone/).
